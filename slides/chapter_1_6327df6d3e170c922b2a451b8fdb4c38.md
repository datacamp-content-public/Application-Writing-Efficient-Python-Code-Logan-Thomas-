`@script`
- As mentioned in the previous section, part of writing efficient Python code means writing code that executes quickly.

- In this lesson, we will learn how to test the runtime of our code.

- Understanding the runtime for a given block of code is an important feature when thinking about efficiency. 

- Comparing runtimes between two code bases that do the same thing allows us to pick the code with the optimal performance.

- By gathering and analyzing runtimes, we can be sure to implement the code that is fastest and thus more efficient.
