As mentioned in the previous section, part of writing efficient Python code means writing code that executes quickly. In this lesson, we will learn how to test the runtime of our code. Understanding the runtime for a given block of code is an important feature when thinking about efficiency. Comparing runtimes between two code bases that do the same thing allows us to pick the code with the optimal performance. By gathering and analyzing runtimes, we can be sure to implement the code that is fastest and thus more efficient.
